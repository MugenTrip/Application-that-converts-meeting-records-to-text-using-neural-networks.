Use 
<addr> `git lfs clone` 
to download the full repository with the pretrained models <br />
If you download the zip file you will need to download separately 2 ".cpkt" models from <br />  "pretrained_models/speech_separation/exp/train_chimera_my_tag" and "pretrained_models/speech_separation/exp_16/train_chimera_my_tag" and place them in same local directory. <br /> <br /> 

Make sure you have install node, python at least 3.7 and pip <br />
Then you will need to install torch,asteroid,speechbrain and pyannote. <br />
Run `npm install` to install the necessary node_modules <br />
  
A complete setup file will be uploaded soon <br />
